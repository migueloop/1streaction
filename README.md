# Challenge process

This project is the result of a challenge process with React + Electron + NodeJS + MongoDB


### React

For this project, you must create a simple page with react. The page must include a header and 2
buttons as like this:

If you press on the button ‘square’, a square must be progressively drawn (The animation to draw
the square is left to your discretion). The shape must be draw with the duplication of this circle
image (or any other shape of your choice). Finally, the name of the shape appears on the header.
Same thing is asked for the diamond shape.

At the end, the shapes should looks like this:

Animations for the buttons are also required. For instance, the button could change color or size if
the mouse is over it. Once done, push your project on your personal github account. Name your
repo for this project “Geometric” and rename the master branch as ‘React’. We will evaluate the
quality of the animations and the algorithmic optimization to draw both shapes

### Bootstrap

Create a new branch to your repo “Geometric” named ‘Bootstrap’. In this branch, you are going to
modify your project to be responsive with Bootstrap. Hence, if you change the window size, the
button and shape should resize, looking like this:

### Electron

Finally, with the same code, use Electron framework to create a native app. Add this project in
another git repo
